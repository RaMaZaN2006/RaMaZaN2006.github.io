    <h2>Longest nails</h2>
    <p><a href="">Nail (anatomy) § Growth says</a></p>
    <p>The longest female nails to ever exist measure a total of 601.9 cm.[1]</p>
    <p>I don't have the source volume, but I see the following problems:</p>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Fingernail_label_%28enwiki%29.jpg" alt="">
    <ol>
        <li>"to ever exist" is unknowable. And this is certainly a fact about the past; even if it was current when published,<br>that was five years ago. Changing to "known to ever have existed".</li>
        <li>601.9 cm =19.75 feet, which is absurdly impossible for a fingernail. The text says "fingernails", plural, and "a total
            of", but these are easy to overlook in a quick read. <br>That comes to an average length of 19¾ inches per fingernail, = 1ʹ 7¾ʺ, which is astonishing but credible. Editing accordingly.

        <h2>Nails in popular culture</h2>
        <p>From [1] Barkham Burroughs' Encyclopaedia of Astounding Facts and Useful Information, 1889 - Author Barkham Burroughs</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A white mark on the nail bespeaks misfortune.</li>
            <li>Pale or lead-colored nails indicate melancholy people.</li>
            <li>Broad nails indicate a gentle, timid, and bashful nature.</li>
            <li>Lovers of knowledge and liberal sentiments have round nails.</li>
            <li>People with narrow nails are ambitious and quarrelsome.</li>
            <li>Small nails indicate littleness of mind, obstinacy and conceit.</li>
            <li>Choleric, martial men, delighting in war, have red and spotted nails.</li>
            <li>Nails growing into the flesh at the points or sides indicate luxurious tastes.</li>
            <li>People with very pale nails are subject to much infirmity of the flesh and persecution by neighbors and friends.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Nelfies</h2>
        <p>The article used as a source for "nelfie" as someone posting a picture of their nails online in no way indicates that's what it is. Rather, that article talks specifically <br>about women getting a portrait of themselves painted on their nails. The link to "nelfie" also doesn't say it's anything to do with nails, but rather a portmanteau of "nude" and "selfie," so I think the sentence should be removed.
