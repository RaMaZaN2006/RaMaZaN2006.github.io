        This article uses anatomical terminology.</p>
        <p>A nail is a protective plate characteristically found at the tip of the digits (fingers and toes) of all primates, corresponding to the claws in other tetrapod animals. Fingernails <br> and toenails are made of a tough rigid protein called alpha-keratin, a polymer also found in the claws, hooves and horns of vertebrates.[1]</p>

    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>The nail consists of the <a href="">nail plate</a>, the nail matrix and the nail bed below it, and the grooves surrounding it.</p>
    <h2>Parts of the nail</h2>
    <p>The nail matrix is the active tissue (or germinal matrix) that generates cells. The <a href="">cells harden</a> as they move outward from the nail root to the nail plate.[3] The nail matrix is also known <br> as the matrix unguis,<a href=""> keratogenous membrane</a>, or onychostroma.[4] It is the part of the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels. The matrix produces cells that become the nail plate. The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip bone determines if the nail plate is flat,<br> arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to produce cells as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition.[5] As new nail plate cells are made, they push older nail plate cells forward; and in this way older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent. This makes the capillaries in the nail bed below visible, resulting in a pink color.[citation needed]

        The lunula ("small moon") is the visible part of the matrix, the <a href=""> whitish </a>crescent-shaped base of the visible nail. The lunula can best be seen in the thumb and may not be visible in the little finger. The lunula appears white due to a reflection of light at the point where the nail matrix and nail bed meet.
        
        The nail bed is the <a href="">skin beneath</a> the nail plate. It is the area of the nail on which the nail plate rests. Nerves and blood vessels found here supply nourishment to the entire nail unit. Like all skin, it is made of two types of tissues: the dermis and the epidermis. The epidermis is attached to the dermis by tiny longitudinal "grooves" called matrix crests <br> (cristae matricis unguis).[3] In old age, the nail plate becomes thinner, and these grooves become more visible.[citation needed] The nail bed is highly innervated, and removal of the nail plate is often excruciatingly painful as a result.[citation needed]</p>
        <br>
        <p>The nail sinus (sinus unguis) is where the nail root is;[3] i.e. the base of the <a href="">nail underneath the skin</a>. It originates from the actively growing <a href=""> tissue below</a>, the matrix.[citation needed]

            The nail plate (corpus unguis)[3] sometimes referred to as the <a href="">nail body</a>, is the visible hard nail area from the nail root to the free edge, made of translucent keratin protein. Several layers of dead, compacted cells cause the nail to be strong but flexible. Its (transverse) shape is determined by the form of the underlying bone.</p>
